# Football Manager (football-sim)

## Introduction
In football-sim, you can become the manager of one of many clubs from around the globe.<br>
The game contains the first division of EVERY country as well as lower divisions for a few countries.

I started this project because I wasn't 100% happy with the leagues included in FIFA (missing leagues, only a few players/clubs for smaller leagues)

## This project / Future plans
This project is a terminal / console application, so there will be no graphics at all.

My plan is to work on a GUI for the game once the core features of the console version are implemented.<br>
Also, I want to add more tournaments like World Cup / EURO Cup, Champions League and much more.

The GUI will be written in either Angular or Vaadin.
