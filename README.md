# Football Manager (football-sim)

## Introduction
In football-sim, you can become the manager of one of many clubs from around the globe.<br>
The game will - once finished - contain EVERY country's first division and also lower divisions of some countries.

I started this project because I wasn't happy with the leagues included in FIFA (missing leagues, only 1 or 2 clubs in league)

## This project / Future plans
This project is a terminal / console application, so there will be no graphics at all.

My plan is to work on a GUI for the game once the core features of the console version are implemented.<br>
Also, I want to add more tournaments like World Cup / EURO Cup, Copa America, Champions League, Europa League and more.

The GUI will most likely be written in either Angular, Vaadin or Java Swing.
