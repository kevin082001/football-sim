# Football Manager (football-sim)

## Introduction
In football-sim, you can become the manager of one of many clubs from around the globe.

The game contains the first division of EVERY country as well as lower divisions for a few countries.

I started this project because I wasn't 100% happy with the leagues included in FIFA (missing leagues, only 2 or 3 players in some leagues)

## This project / Future plans
This project is a terminal / console application, so there will be no graphics at all.

My plan is to work on a GUI for the game once the console version is (more or less) finished.

The GUI will be written in either Angular, Vaadin or OpenGL
